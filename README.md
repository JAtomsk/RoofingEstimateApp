# RoofingEstimateApp

**RoofingEstimateApp** is a Java Spring Boot application designed for roofing contractors to store customer data and generate basic roofing estimates based on roof size and a customizable price per square. This backend system is being developed as a hands-on way to reinforce core programming and architecture skills through a real-world use case.

## 🔍 Overview

This project is currently in active development. It's part of my self-guided learning journey to become a job-ready software developer by building tools rooted in real-world experience.

---

## ✔️ What’s Working Now

- Spring Boot backend initialized with Maven
- Local MySQL database integration (tested and running)
- Customer entity with validation and database persistence
- REST API endpoints for creating and retrieving customers
- Tested endpoints using Postman
- Input validation using Jakarta annotations

---

## 🚧 In Progress

- Estimate logic: calculating total = `roofSize * pricePerSquare`
- Building out Estimate entity and relationships
- Adding service layers and separating business logic
- Improving request/response formatting and documentation

---

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

- Java backend development from the ground up
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and MVC architecture
- Spring Boot fundamentals, including JPA and validation
- Working with relational databases using MySQL and AWS RDS
- Testing APIs with Postman and troubleshooting connection issues

## 🌱 Why I’m Building This

This app combines two sides of my background: roofing and software. By building something I could actually use in the real world, I’m gaining meaningful experience in backend development while sharpening my software fundamentals. This project is helping me grow into a capable, job-ready developer.
